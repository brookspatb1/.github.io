This is for test usage of IPNS/IPFS/Web3Storage

Hopefully, I'll be able to set everything up to run a website hosted in a decentralized fashion. The domain name will be hosted privately but the files
will be served from IPFS using Web3-Storage. This will be notably slower but I more or less wanted to test the capabilities of everything. It is important to keep in mind that any files stored using the web3 storage can be copied and stored permissionlessly by others and stored indefinitely. Be careful what you decide to share. GitHub pages were used to setup the push action and to try to make everything as easy as possible.

Reminder to self of things I've done so far:
1. Setup an account and token on web3.storage
2. Setup an action to update with a push
3. Setup secret for action
4. Setup gh cli
5. Connected gh cli via token
6.
