This is for test usage of IPNS/IPFS/Web3Storage

Hopefully, I'll be able to set everything up to run a website hosted in a decentralized fashion. The domain name will be hosted privately but the files
will be served from IPFS using Web3-Storage.

Reminder to self of things I've done so far:
1. Setup an account and token on web3.storage
2. Setup an action to update with a push
3. Setup secret for action
4. Setup gh cli
5.
